# Career Coaching
Career Planning, Resume Reviews, Mock Interviews. Hi, I'm Colin, and I'm a Google Software Engineer volunteering this semester to provide all of these opportunites for exclusively Hampton students. I'll help you plan and focus your effort to achieve your wildest career goals.

Each coaching session is personal, and each type of coaching has a unique benefit. Please take advantage of these great opportunities.

## Career Planning
You might already know why you're taking CS151. You also might know what you want to do with the degree you've chosen to pursue.

If you do know both, schedule a Career Planning session. Together, we'll chart your path from A to B to maximize your chances of achieving your goals.

If you don't know what you're doing here or what you want to do in the future, *please* schedule a Career Planning session. You'll learn all the amazing opportunities that this class will open you up to. Explore various career paths in tech with someone who interacts with people in those fields everyday, learn how your strengths set you up to succeed in these roles, and get started on your journey.

## Resume Reviews
Learn how to show yourself off. Resumes are your way to flex your strengths by highlighting all the hard work you've put in and challenges you've overcome.

Think you don't have enough to show in a resume? Come discuss your experiences, we'll piece them together in a way that will resonate with recruiters while painting an accurate picture of who you are.

## Mock Interviews
Technical interviews are a significant part of the job search process, and technical interviewing is very much a practiced skill.

Mock interviews give you a controlled place to develop it.

We will start by simulating what a real technical interview may be like with various companies so you can better understand what to expect. I'll come prepared with a few technical questions of various difficulties, and you'll answer them as you would in an interview. Just as in an actual technical interview, asking clarifying questions is a *good* thing, and if something is confusing then we'll talk through it together.

Afterwards, I'll provide you with feedback as well as tips on how to improve your interviewing skills.

### Want extra Technical Interviewing resources?

- [CodingBat Practice Problems](https://codingbat.com/java){:target="_blank"} has good warmup problems and will track nicely along class this semester
- [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/){:target="_blank"} is a wonderful (and huge) book that walks you through all of the most common knowledge technical interviews expect and lays out how to use it to solve almost any problem you'll be asked. It is aimed at Computer Science Juniors through early professionals, but is one of the most comprehensive resources. I still have it on my shelf!
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/){:target="_blank"} has a nearly infinite database of practice questions of all difficulty levels with automatic testing and community solutions
