## Overview
Welcome to CS151! We’re really excited to have you on board with us this Fall for a gentle but thorough introduction to computer science. The course is designed for students with no formal exposure to computer science or programming. The goal is to provide a thorough introduction to computer science that will prepare students to either take further computer science courses, or use computer science in their field of study.

By the end of the course, students will learn
 - Variables, Expressions, Types
 - Input/Output
 - Logic and Control Flow
 - Functions
 - Algorithms
 - Objects and Classes

## Course Meetings
Lectures, labs, and office hours are the main ways in which you will interact with your professor and TAs. You can see the weekly schedule of course meetings on the [course schedule page](schedule.md).

<!-- ### Lecture
Lectures for this course will be 100% virtual. This class will use a flipped classroom model, where lecture videos will be sent out before class that you must watch. You will be expected to have watched the videos before class. Classtime will then be spent on answering student questions on the material, and working through practice problems. You are expected to come to each class, having watched the lecture videos, as there will be weekly quizzes given at a random time during class. 

### Labs
Lab for this course will be 100% virtual. Labs will allow you to apply the new concepts that you're learning in lecture to broader, graded problems. You will be given problems to solve, that you'll be able to work on with your peers in groups of 4. Your labs will be submitted on Mimir and graded by the Mimir autograder. Labs will be released each Wednesday evening, and will be due the following Tuesday at 11:59pm. 

You should take advantage of labs as you can ask the professor or TAs for help on completing the assignments.  -->

<!-- ### Office Hours

We will hold a mixture of in-person and virtual office hours at a wide variety of times. Virtual office hours will be held on Zoom, the link can be found at the [course schedule page](schedule.md). In-person office hours will be held in Prof. Krentsel's office. You are welcome to come for any reason, including course material questions, lecture clarifications, industry interview prep, career path discussions, or just to hang out. 

As a course, we commit to making sure no student fails the class due to lack of class resources, so if you are behind or confused, please reach out for help. The course staff will make themselves as available as possible to help you. -->

## Primary Course Components

- **Concept Videos**:  Lecture introduces concepts and gives you and overview of what is happening in labs and discussions. Each lecture will be followed with self-check questions which you can answer online via Gradescope, which are counted as part of participation and attendance.

- **Discussion Sections**: Discussion sections are where you will delve into the content more deeply with worksheets in traditional “pen-and-paper” style. This is where you will develop the theoretical computational skills needed to understand the basics of programming. Attendance is not required, but you can earn points (see below) by attending.

- **Lab Sections**: Labs are the primary place you will learn to program. To earn full credit for a lab, it must be completed, submitted, and checked off. Checkoff can be done either in lab or in office hours. If you have a special circumstance where you are unable to check-off a lab, please email laralinmcc@gmail.com. Each lab will be due one week after the lab is assigned. For example, a lab assigned on a Tuesday will be due the following Tuesday. There will be at least 12 total labs — but only your top 10 lab scores will count towards your grade. Each lab is worth 4 points. Half a point will be deducted for each day that a lab is checked off late; however, a maximum of 2 points will be deducted for any given lab. 

You should take advantage of labs as you can ask the professor or TAs for help on completing the assignments.

- **Office Hours**: During office hours, you can meet with a TA or Lara for help with course material, assignments, or bigger picture questions.e will hold a mixture of in-person and virtual office hours at a wide variety of times. Virtual office hours will be held on Zoom, the link can be found at the course schedule page. In-person office hours will be held in Lara's office. You are welcome to come for any reason, including course material questions, lecture clarifications, industry interview prep, career path discussions, or just to hang out.

As a course, we commit to making sure no student fails the class due to lack of class resources, so if you are behind or confused, please reach out for help. The course staff will make themselves as available as possible to help you.

- **Participation and Attendance**: You can receive points for this category by attending discussion, lab, and doing post-lecture questions. Note that there will be more than 30 points available (so you can still get full points in this category if you miss section or don’t do post-lecture questions one week) and that once you reach 30, your grade will cap out there (no extra credit if you get above 30; just full points(: ).

- **Project and Homework Description**: These assignments will be one of the best ways for you to apply what you have learned in lecture, lab and discussion. These will be a bit more time intensive than the other assignments and will require you to be caught up on the other components of the class. Homeworks will tend to be a bit less difficult and time intensive, while projects will take a bit longer and require more work on your part. Note that you may use 6 slip days (explained in more detail below) total this semester on assignments in this category.

### Grades
The class will *not* be curved. Instead, your final grade will be based on buckets of your overall score in the class that will be decided at the end of the semester based on the difficulty of the exams, quizzes, projects, labs, and homework.

Your overall grade will be calculated using the following relative weights:

| Assignment Type | # of Assignments | Number Dropped | Points | Weight in Overall Grade |
|:-------------|:------------------|:------|:------|
| Concept Checks | 24 | 4 | 40 | 8% |
| Lecture Self-Checks | 24 | 4 | 10 | 2% |
| Labs | 12 | 2 | 60 | 12% |
| Quest | 1 | 0  | 20 | 4% |
| Midterm | 1 | 0  | 50 | 10% |
| Final Exam | 1 | 0  | 80 | 16% |
| Homework 0 | 1 | 0  | 5 | 1% |
| Homework 1 | 1 | 0  | 20 | 4% |
| Homework 2 | 1 | 0  | 20 | 4% |
| Explore Post | 1 | 0  | 20 | 4% |
| Midterm Project | 1 | 0  | 75 | 15% |
| Final Project | 1 | 0 | 100 | 20% |

### Assignments
These details are subject to change during the semester, however the current plan of record is the following:

- ~24 Concept Checks - Held at the beginning of lecture section. Graded on correctness.
- ~24 Lecture Self-Checks - Due before lecture section. Graded on completion.
- 12 Labs - 1x per week. Work w/ partners, submit individually.
- 2 Homeworks - spread throughout the semester. Work individually, submit individually.
- 2 Projects - Music Generator and Final Project. Work individually or with a partner.

Assignments will be due at 11:59pm, with a 10% penalty per each day that the assignment is late up to 5 days total.

### Pro-Student Grading Policies
- **Absolute-Clobber Policy**: If either your midterm or final exam score is higher than your quest score, we will replace your quest score with the maximum of your midterm and final exam scores. If your final exam score is higher than your midterm score, we will replace your midterm score with your final exam score. For example, if you receive a 70% on the midterm but an 85% on the final, at the end of the semester your midterm score will also be upgraded to 85%. 

- **Slip Days**: Each student will receive 6 slip days, to be used for homeworks and projects only. Each slip day allows you to extend the deadline period by one day with no penalty. For example, if a project is due Friday at 11:59 PM PT, you may turn it in without penalty up until Saturday at 11:59 PM PT by using one slip day. Note: You can use a maximum of three slip days per project.

- **Late Submissions**: Late submissions for projects will be handled on a case-by-case basis. If you are out of slip days for a project but cannot make a deadline, please contact laralinmcc@gmail.com figure out an extension. If you do not reach out to anyone in advance, we reserve the right to mark the submission down by 10% for each day that it is late.

<!-- ### Exams
Instead of one midterm and one final exam, this course will have 3 exams, spaced evenly across the semester, with the third exam happening during finals week. Exam 1 will be on Wednesday, September 22nd. Exam 2 is will be on Monday, November 1st. Exam 3 will take place during finals week. 

### Cheating

For all assignments in the course, you may discuss approaches to solving a problem or work in the same room on separate computers to individually solve a problem, but **you may *not* copy and paste code or substantially copy ideas from another student**. It can be tempting to cheat. Know that Mimir's autograder has a very good plagiarism detector. Per Howard University policy, the first time an assignment is found to be plagiarized, the assignment grade will be zero-ed out for all students with matching code. The second time, all students involved will have their final course grade decreased by 1 letter grade (B going to a C, A- does to a B-, etc.). The third time, all students involved will be referred to the Dean's office for academic dishonesty. 

If I ask you how your code works and you do not know, it will be evident that you have copied it. Don't take the risk. Despite this explicit warning, each year, a few students still cheat and are caught. I do not enjoy catching and penalizing students for plagiarism, but it's necessary for 

The course staff will work tirelessly to provide enough support for any student to get help and make it through the class. In exchange, we ask you to uphold academic integrity and not to plagiarize code or ideas.

## Resources

This course website, [csci100.org](https://www.csci100.org), will be your one-stop resource for the syllabus, schedule, lecture videos, and assignment links. Additionally, we will be using the following software.

**Mimir**
You will get a link to sign up for this tool when we begin class. We will use Mimir for editing and turning in assignments. Note that Mimir may display a “grade” for you, but the official one is in Blackboard.

**Piazza**
This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TA, and myself. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. You can find the [class Piazza here](https://piazza.com/howard/fall2021/csci100/home).

**Zoom**
In light of the large class size and COVID risks, our weekly lectures and labs will be taught virtually over Zoom. You can find the Zoom link for your section at [https://csci100.org/schedule/](https://csci100.org/schedule/).

**Blackboard**
Your official class midterm and final grades will be published in Blackboard. You should already have a Blackboard account. Get in touch with your advisor if you can't access the course on Blackboard. Other than occasionally syncing grades to Blackboard, we will not be using Blackboard.

### Material Attribution
We'd like to thank UC Berkeley's [CS10: The Beauty and Joy of Computing](https://cs10.org/fa19/) and [CS61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa15/), from which this course borrows high-level topics and organization. Course material will be created by Prof. Alex Krentsel, borrowing from past itera -->tions of this course at Howard taught by GIR instructors.
