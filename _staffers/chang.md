Hi folks ðŸ‘‹ I'm Chang and I currently work on the Google Workspace for Education team. Prior to that, I studied at Rutgers University for my Bachelors, and worked at LinkedIn for 4 years, working mostly on LinkedIn Learning. In my spare time, I like to enjoy the bay area outdoors with my two pups (who may occasionally disturb my video calls)
