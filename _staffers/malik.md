Hello everyone, I'm Malik! I am originally from Durham, North Carolina and it is also where I stayed for college at NC State University. After college I moved to the SF Bay Area to join Google and now I am a SWE on the Google Workspace Growth team where I work on developing new value propositions for acquiring Workspace users. I'm currently listening to: Charlie XCX, Beyonce's Renaissance Album, and RosalÃ­a.
