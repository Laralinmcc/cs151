I'm originally from Kansas and graduated from the University of Kansas in 2021. I'm now a Software Engineer at Google in the Mountain View headquarters working on Android Messages and RCS. I love hiking, running, and reading (I'm currently six books into the Wheel of Time series). Fun fact: I skipped my first day of classes at KU to go watch the solar eclipse in 2017.
